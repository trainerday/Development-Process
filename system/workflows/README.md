# Workflows

**Purpose**: Process documentation that explains **how to do things** within the Claude Code OS system.

Workflows are **procedures and processes** - step-by-step guidance for accomplishing tasks, making decisions, and following established patterns.


## Current Workflows
- `automated-development/` - Complete end-to-end automated development process
  - `automation-spec.md` - Master specification including all 4 development modes
  - `0-queue-processing.md` - Queue management and task automation orchestration
  - `1-spec-process.md` - Specification generation and backlog management
  - `2-development-process.md` - Code implementation and development standards
  - `3-testing-process.md` - Local testing, visual validation, and quality assurance
  - `4-task-completion.md` - Post-completion archival and documentation workflow

## When to Add Workflows
- Complex processes need documentation
- Decision-making procedures require clarity
- Multi-step tasks need standardization
- Team coordination processes emerge
- Best practices are established
