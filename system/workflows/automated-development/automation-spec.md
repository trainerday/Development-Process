# Automated Development Specification

## Process Steps
1. **Queue Management**: [0-queue-processing.md](0-queue-processing.md)
2. **Specification Generation**: [1-spec-process.md](1-spec-process.md)
3. **Development Implementation**: [2-development-process.md](2-development-process.md)  
4. **Testing Validation**: [3-testing-process.md](3-testing-process.md)
5. **Task Completion**: [4-task-completion.md](4-task-completion.md)

## Overview
Complete end-to-end automated development process where Claude Code handles all tasks from initial requirements to production deployment with minimal human intervention.

## Process Flow

### 1. Requirements Input
- Human provides: feature description, acceptance criteria, context and moves task to next.md with link to details specs. 
- Claude Code analyzes: existing codebase, system architecture, dependencies

### 2. Specification Generation
- Claude Code creates: detailed technical specifications, implementation plan, test strategy
- Output: comprehensive spec document for human review

	
### 3. Human Approval Gate
- Human reviews: generated specifications, implementation approach, potential risks
- Decision: approve, request changes, or reject

### 4. Automated Implementation
- Claude Code executes: code generation, file creation, integration points
- Follows: established patterns, coding standards, architectural decisions
- Updates: documentation, comments, type definitions


### 5. Automated Testing
- Claude Code generates: unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests
- Executes: test suites, validates functionality, checks regressions
- Reports: test coverage, failures, performance metrics


### 6. Automated Deployment
- Claude Code deploys: to staging environment automatically
- Runs: staging validation tests, performance checks
- Documents: deployment changes, environment differences

### 7. Human Final Approval
- Human reviews: test results, staging functionality, deployment readiness
- Decision: approve for production or request modifications

### 8. Production Deployment
- Claude Code deploys: to production environment
- Monitors: initial performance, error rates, user impact
- Updates: system state documentation, completion status

## Success Criteria
- Zero human intervention during implementation and testing phases
- Comprehensive test coverage and validation
- Complete documentation of all changes
- Successful production deployment with monitoring



## Development Modes

### Mode 1: Manual Development
**Flow**: Human moves items through stages
- **1-backlog → 2-next**: Human decision
- **2-next → 3-in-progress**: Human starts work
- **3-in-progress → 4-staging**: Human deploys
- **4-staging → 5-testing**: Claude Code auto-tests
- **5-testing → 6-test-results**: Claude Code provides results
- **6-test-results → 7-approved**: Human reviews and approves

### Mode 2: AI-Assisted Development  
**Flow**: Human-led with AI assistance
- **1-backlog → 2-next**: Human decision
- **2-next → 3-in-progress**: Human + AI tools implement
- **3-in-progress → 4-staging**: Human deploys
- **4-staging → 5-testing**: Claude Code auto-tests
- **5-testing → 6-test-results**: Claude Code provides results
- **6-test-results → 7-approved**: Human reviews and approves

### Mode 3: Collaborative Development
**Flow**: Human-Claude partnership
- **1-backlog → 2-next**: Human decision
- **2-next → 3-in-progress**: Human triggers: "let's work on this together"
- **During 3-in-progress**: Back-and-forth collaboration, "let's move to next part" advances sub-tasks
- **3-in-progress → 4-staging**: Claude Code deploys when complete
- **4-staging → 5-testing**: Claude Code auto-tests
- **5-testing → 6-test-results**: Claude Code provides results
- **6-test-results → 7-approved**: Human reviews and approves

### Mode 4: Autonomous Development (This Specification)
**Flow**: Complete autonomous development with specification approval
- **Reference**: This document - full automation process
- **Command**: "process dev queue"
- **Human Role**: Approve specifications and implementation steps
- **Claude Role**: Generate specs, implement code, test locally, deploy to staging

## Universal Rules
- Only humans move items to 2-next (prioritization decision)
- Only humans move items from 6-test-results to 7-approved (final approval)
- Claude Code owns 4-staging → 5-testing → 6-test-results (testing pipeline)
- Failed tests return items to 4-staging with feedback
