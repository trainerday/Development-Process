# Testing Process

## Local Testing (Dev Testing)

*Instructions for Claude Code on how to test implementations locally during development*

### When to Run Local Testing
- After completing development work in `3-in-progress`
- Before moving items to `4-staging`

### Local Testing Steps

0. **Install Testing Dependencies (if needed)**
   - Check if Puppeteer is installed: `npm list puppeteer`
   - If not installed, run: `npm install --save-dev puppeteer`
   - This will also download Chromium for headless testing

1. **Start Local Server**
   - Check if server is already running (test localhost connection)
   - If server is not running, execute: `npm run dev` or `npm start`
   - Verify server starts without errors
   - Note the local URL (typically `http://localhost:3000` or similar)
   - Wait for server to be fully ready before proceeding

2. **Screenshot Capture & AI Analysis**
   - Create automated test file in project's `testing/` folder
   - Use Puppeteer for screenshot capture and testing
   - **Create test file**: `testing/[feature-name]-visual-test.js`
   - **For home page**: Run standard visual tests on the home page (`testing/index-visual-test.js`)
   - Test should:
     - Launch headless Chrome with Puppeteer
     - Navigate to the implemented feature
     - Take screenshots of key pages/features
     - Capture both desktop (1920x1080) and mobile (375x667) viewports
     - Save screenshots to `testing/screenshots/` folder
     - Check for console errors
     - Check for network 404s
     - Verify key elements are present
   - **Send screenshots to OpenAI Vision API for analysis**
     - Use API key from environment variable
     - **Reference visual standards template** (trainer-day/templates/visual-standards-template.md)
     - Ask specific validation questions:
       * "Are there any broken images, missing assets, or 404 placeholders visible?"
       * "Does the layout look professional and properly aligned?"
       * "Are all UI elements rendering correctly (buttons, forms, text, navigation)?"
       * "Does this page match modern web design standards?"
       * "Are there any obvious visual bugs or styling issues?"
       * "Is the content readable and properly formatted?"
       * **"Does this follow our visual standards: Poppins font, TrainerDay logo present, consistent input heights?"**
       * **"Does this implementation match the task specifications and requirements?"**
       * **"Are all the features/elements mentioned in the task requirements actually present and visible?"**
       * **"Are all text input boxes the same height?"**
       * **"Are all dropdown/select boxes the same height as the text inputs?"**
       * **"Do all form elements have consistent visual styling and alignment?"**
     - Get AI assessment: Pass/Fail with specific issues noted

3. **Visual Validation**
   - Review OpenAI vision analysis results
   - If AI reports any issues, investigate and fix before proceeding
   - Manual verification of AI findings:
     - Missing or broken images/assets (like logos)
     - Layout issues or misaligned elements
     - Correct fonts and styling
     - Responsive design working properly

4. **Console & Network Error Checking**
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Check Console tab for JavaScript errors:
     - Red error messages
     - Uncaught exceptions
     - Failed function calls
   - Check Network tab for failed requests:
     - 404 errors (missing files)
     - 500 server errors
     - Failed CSS/JS/image loads
     - Any red entries indicating failed requests
   - Document all errors found with details
   - **Critical**: No JavaScript errors or 404s should exist for basic functionality

5. **Basic Functional Testing**
   - Test key interactions (clicks, form submissions, navigation)
   - Verify all links work and don't produce console errors
   - Check that JavaScript functionality works as expected
   - Test core functionality of the feature

6. **Generate Test Report**
   - Document what was tested
   - Note any issues found
   - Mark as "Passed Local Testing" or "Failed - needs fixes"
   - **Save test report in project's `testing/` folder**
   - **File name should match the backlog item name** (e.g., `design-main-ui-ux-and-power-to-speed-calculator-test-report.md`)
   - Include screenshots and OpenAI analysis results in the report

### Success Criteria
- All screenshots show expected visual results
- OpenAI vision analysis reports no critical issues
- **Zero JavaScript errors in browser console**
- **Zero 404 errors or failed network requests**
- Core functionality works as intended
- Feature meets basic requirements

## Staging Testing (Future)
*More comprehensive integration testing will be documented here later*

## Screenshot Capture & AI Analysis
   - Create automated test file in project's `testing/` folder
   - Use Puppeteer for screenshot capture and testing
   - **Create test file**: `testing/[feature-name]-visual-test.js`
   - **For home page**: Run standard visual tests on the home page (`testing/index-visual-test.js`)
   - Test should:
     - Launch headless Chrome with Puppeteer
     - Navigate to the implemented feature
     - Take screenshots of key pages/features
     - Capture both desktop (1920x1080) and mobile (375x667) viewports
     - Save screenshots to `testing/temp/screenshots/` folder (add temp to .gitignore)
     - Check for console errors
     - Check for network 404s
     - Verify key elements are present
     - **Check form element height consistency** (all inputs/dropdowns should be same height)
     - **Check label alignment across form rows** (labels on same row should have 0px vertical offset)
     - **Handle responsive layouts** (skip row alignment checks for single-column mobile layouts)
   - **Physics/Calculation Accuracy Testing** (for calculator features):
     - If original calculator URL is provided in specifications, test accuracy against it
     - Use test values (e.g., 100W, 250W) to compare results
     - Results should be within acceptable tolerance (typically Â±10%)
     - Document any significant calculation differences
   - **Send screenshots to OpenAI Vision API for analysis**
     - Use API key from environment variable  
     - **Use critical visual inspection prompt**:
       ```
       CRITICAL VISUAL INSPECTION: Look very carefully at this [Feature Name] interface screenshot. I need you to identify ANY visual inconsistencies, no matter how small.

       SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS TO CHECK:
       1. FORM ELEMENT HEIGHTS: Look at ALL input boxes and dropdown boxes. Are they EXACTLY the same height? Even a 1-2 pixel difference is a problem.
       2. ALIGNMENT: Are form elements aligned properly on the same baseline?
       3. VISUAL BUGS: Any broken images, missing assets, or 404 placeholders?
       4. PROFESSIONAL APPEARANCE: Does this look like a polished, production-ready interface?
       5. CONSISTENCY: Do all similar elements (inputs, dropdowns, buttons) have identical styling?

       PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO:
       - **LABEL ALIGNMENT**: Are the labels above form fields properly aligned?
       - **ROW ALIGNMENT**: For form fields on the same row, are their labels at the same height/baseline?
       - **LEFT ALIGNMENT**: Are labels on the same row aligned to the left edge consistently?
       - **LABEL HEIGHT**: Do labels take up the same vertical space across a row?

       BE EXTREMELY CRITICAL. If you see ANY visual inconsistencies, report them. Don't overlook height differences, alignment issues, or styling inconsistencies.

       Respond with a JSON object:
       {
         "issues": ["specific description of each visual problem found"],
         "height_consistency": "good/poor - describe any height differences you see",
         "label_alignment": "good/poor - describe any label alignment issues",
         "row_alignment": "good/poor - describe if elements on the same row are properly aligned",
         "overall_assessment": "detailed assessment"
       }
       ```
     - **Reference visual standards template** (trainer-day/templates/visual-standards-template.md)
     - Ask specific validation questions:
       * "Are there any broken images, missing assets, or 404 placeholders visible?"
       * "Does the layout look professional and properly aligned?"
       * "Are all UI elements rendering correctly (buttons, forms, text, navigation)?"
       * "Does this page match modern web design standards?"
       * "Are there any obvious visual bugs or styling issues?"
       * "Is the content readable and properly formatted?"
       * **"Does this follow our visual standards: Poppins font, TrainerDay logo present, consistent input heights?"**
       * **"Does this implementation match the task specifications and requirements?"**
       * **"Are all the features/elements mentioned in the task requirements actually present and visible?"**
     - Get AI assessment: Pass/Fail with specific issues noted

### Calculator Accuracy Testing Template

For calculator features, add accuracy validation:

```javascript
// Add to test after basic functionality tests
async function testCalculatorAccuracy(page) {
  console.log('ð§® Testing calculator accuracy...');
  
  const testCases = [
    { power: 100, expectedSpeed: null }, // Will be filled from original calculator
    { power: 250, expectedSpeed: null }
  ];
  
  // If original calculator URL provided, test against it first
  const originalCalculatorURL = '[ORIGINAL_CALCULATOR_URL]'; // From specifications
  
  if (originalCalculatorURL) {
    console.log('ð Comparing against original calculator...');
    
    for (const testCase of testCases) {
      // Test our calculator
      await page.evaluate((power) => {
        document.querySelector('#powerOutput').value = power;
        // Trigger calculation
        document.querySelector('#powerOutput').dispatchEvent(new Event('input'));
      }, testCase.power);
      
      await page.waitForTimeout(500); // Allow calculation
      const ourResult = await page.$eval('#speedResult', el => parseFloat(el.textContent));
      
      // Test original calculator (if accessible)
      try {
        const originalPage = await browser.newPage();
        await originalPage.goto(originalCalculatorURL);
        // Set values and get result from original calculator
        // This will vary based on original calculator's interface
        const originalResult = await getOriginalCalculatorResult(originalPage, testCase.power);
        
        const difference = Math.abs(ourResult - originalResult);
        const percentDifference = (difference / originalResult) * 100;
        
        console.log(`  Power ${testCase.power}W: Our result: ${ourResult}, Original: ${originalResult}, Difference: ${percentDifference.toFixed(1)}%`);
        
        if (percentDifference > 10) { // Allow 10% tolerance
          testResults.warnings.push(`Calculator accuracy issue: ${testCase.power}W shows ${percentDifference.toFixed(1)}% difference from original`);
        }
        
        await originalPage.close();
      } catch (error) {
        testResults.warnings.push(`Could not test against original calculator: ${error.message}`);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Enhanced Layout Testing with Overlap Detection

### Overlap Detection Requirements
All visual tests must include specific overlap detection to catch layout issues:

#### JavaScript-Based Overlap Detection
```javascript
// Add to Puppeteer tests
async function checkForOverlaps(page, device) {
  return await page.evaluate(() => {
    const overlaps = [];
    
    // Get all visible elements with significant size
    const elements = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('*')).filter(el => {
      const rect = el.getBoundingClientRect();
      return rect.width > 10 && rect.height > 10 && 
             getComputedStyle(el).visibility !== 'hidden' &&
             getComputedStyle(el).display !== 'none';
    });
    
    // Check for overlaps between elements
    for (let i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
      for (let j = i + 1; j < elements.length; j++) {
        const el1 = elements[i];
        const el2 = elements[j];
        
        // Skip if one element contains the other
        if (el1.contains(el2) || el2.contains(el1)) continue;
        
        const rect1 = el1.getBoundingClientRect();
        const rect2 = el2.getBoundingClientRect();
        
        // Check for overlap
        const overlap = !(rect1.right <= rect2.left || 
                         rect2.right <= rect1.left || 
                         rect1.bottom <= rect2.top || 
                         rect2.bottom <= rect1.top);
        
        if (overlap) {
          const overlapWidth = Math.min(rect1.right, rect2.right) - Math.max(rect1.left, rect2.left);
          const overlapHeight = Math.min(rect1.bottom, rect2.bottom) - Math.max(rect1.top, rect2.top);
          const overlapArea = overlapWidth * overlapHeight;
          
          // Only report significant overlaps (> 100 square pixels)
          if (overlapArea > 100) {
            overlaps.push({
              element1: el1.tagName + (el1.id ? '#' + el1.id : ''),
              element2: el2.tagName + (el2.id ? '#' + el2.id : ''),
              overlapArea: Math.round(overlapArea)
            });
          }
        }
      }
    }
    
    return { overlaps };
  });
}
```

#### Enhanced OpenAI Vision Prompt for Overlap Detection
```
CRITICAL LAYOUT INSPECTION: Examine this [Feature Name] interface screenshot for ANY layout issues, especially overlapping elements.

SPECIFIC OVERLAP DETECTION REQUIREMENTS:
1. **OVERLAPPING ELEMENTS**: Look for ANY elements that overlap, cover, or obstruct other elements
2. **TEXT OVERLAP**: Check if any text overlaps with other text, buttons, or form elements
3. **BUTTON OVERLAP**: Verify buttons don't overlap with each other or other UI elements
4. **FORM OVERLAP**: Ensure form inputs, labels, and dropdowns don't overlap
5. **NAVIGATION OVERLAP**: Check if navigation overlaps with main content
6. **CONTENT OVERFLOW**: Look for any content extending beyond its container boundaries

CRITICAL VISUAL ISSUES TO DETECT:
- Elements positioned on top of each other incorrectly
- Text that runs into other text or elements
- Buttons that cover or are covered by other elements
- Form elements that overlap with labels or other inputs
- Any UI element that appears "cut off" or partially hidden
- Misaligned elements that create visual conflicts

LAYOUT CONSISTENCY CHECKS:
1. FORM ELEMENT HEIGHTS: Are all input boxes and dropdown boxes exactly the same height?
2. ALIGNMENT: Are form elements aligned properly on the same baseline?
3. VISUAL BUGS: Any broken images, missing assets, or 404 placeholders?
4. PROFESSIONAL APPEARANCE: Does this look polished and production-ready?
5. CONSISTENCY: Do all similar elements have identical styling and proper spacing?

BE EXTREMELY DETAILED about any overlapping elements. If elements are overlapping, describe:
- Which specific elements are overlapping
- Where the overlap occurs (top, bottom, left, right)
- How severe the overlap is

Respond with a JSON object:
{
  "issues": ["specific description of each overlap or layout problem found"],
  "overlap_detected": true/false,
  "overlap_details": ["detailed description of each overlap found"],
  "height_consistency": "good/poor - describe any height differences",
  "label_alignment": "good/poor - describe any label alignment issues",
  "layout_assessment": "good/poor - describe overall layout quality",
  "critical_issues": ["any critical layout problems that must be fixed"],
  "overall_assessment": "detailed assessment focusing on overlaps and layout"
}
```

### Overlap Testing Requirements

â **Mandatory Overlap Checks**
- JavaScript-based geometric overlap detection
- OpenAI vision analysis focusing on visual overlaps
- Multi-device testing (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Element boundary validation
- Content overflow detection

â **Overlap Reporting**
- Document all overlaps > 100 square pixels
- Identify specific elements involved
- Calculate overlap area and severity
- Generate visual evidence via screenshots
- Create actionable fix recommendations

â **Acceptable vs Critical Overlaps**
- **Acceptable**: Intentional overlays (modals, tooltips, dropdowns)
- **Critical**: Unintentional overlaps affecting usability
- **Blocking**: Any overlap that obscures interactive elements
- **Minor**: Small overlaps (<50pxÂ²) that don't affect function

This enhanced testing catches layout issues early and ensures professional, polished interfaces.

## Enhanced GPT Instructions for Layout Issue Detection

### Critical Visual Inspection Prompt Template

When analyzing screenshots with OpenAI Vision API, use this enhanced prompt to catch layout width issues:

```
CRITICAL LAYOUT INSPECTION: Examine this [Feature Name] interface screenshot for ANY layout issues, especially width and container problems.

SPECIFIC WIDTH AND CONTAINER DETECTION REQUIREMENTS:
1. **INPUT BOX WIDTH**: Are input boxes appropriately sized for their containers? Look for:
   - Input boxes that appear too wide for their grid containers
   - Form elements extending beyond their allocated space
   - Inconsistent spacing between form elements
   - Unit labels (like "kg", "watts") being cut off or extending beyond containers

2. **CONTAINER OVERFLOW**: Check for any content extending beyond container boundaries:
   - Text or elements that get cut off at the edges
   - Horizontal scrollbars appearing when they shouldn't
   - Elements extending beyond the visible viewport
   - Form grids that are too wide for their parent containers

3. **RESPONSIVE LAYOUT ISSUES**: Look for:
   - Elements that break layout on smaller screens
   - Mobile layouts where text or elements extend beyond screen width
   - Inconsistent margins or padding causing alignment issues
   - Form elements that don't adapt properly to available space

4. **VISUAL SPACING PROBLEMS**: Identify:
   - Inconsistent gaps between form elements
   - Elements that appear cramped or too spread out
   - Uneven margins around containers
   - Poor utilization of available space

CRITICAL MEASUREMENTS TO ASSESS:
- Do input boxes fit comfortably within their grid cells?
- Are unit labels (kg, watts, mph, etc.) fully visible and not truncated?
- Is there adequate spacing between form elements?
- Does the overall form width make good use of available space?
- Are there any elements that appear "squished" or "stretched"?

WIDTH-SPECIFIC ISSUES TO DETECT:
- Form fields that are too narrow and look cramped
- Form fields that are too wide and break layout
- Grid containers that don't provide adequate space for their contents
- Unit labels extending beyond their designated areas
- Input groups that overflow their parent containers

BE EXTREMELY DETAILED about width and container issues. Report:
- Specific elements with width problems
- Measurements or estimates of how elements extend beyond boundaries
- Whether the overall layout feels appropriately sized
- Any text or labels that appear cut off

Respond with a JSON object:
{
  "issues": ["specific description of each width/layout problem found"],
  "width_issues": ["detailed description of any width-related problems"],
  "container_overflow": ["elements extending beyond their containers"],
  "unit_label_cutoff": true/false,
  "form_width_assessment": "too_narrow/appropriate/too_wide",
  "spacing_quality": "poor/good/excellent",
  "mobile_compatibility": "good/poor - describe any mobile layout issues",
  "critical_fixes_needed": ["immediate layout problems that must be addressed"],
  "overall_assessment": "detailed assessment focusing on width and container issues"
}
```

### Container Width Testing Checklist

When implementing visual tests, ensure these width-specific checks are included:

â **Form Container Validation**
- Check form-grid width relative to parent container
- Verify input-with-unit groups fit within their allocated space
- Measure unit label positioning and ensure no cutoff
- Test responsive behavior at different screen sizes

â **Element Boundary Checks**
- JavaScript measurement of element boundaries vs container boundaries
- Detection of horizontal overflow beyond viewport
- Form element width consistency across different field types
- Grid cell utilization and spacing validation

â **Multi-Device Width Testing**
- Desktop layout width optimization
- Tablet breakpoint behavior
- Mobile single-column layout validation
- Responsive scaling of form elements

â **Specific GPT Instructions for Width Issues**
- Enhanced prompts focusing on container boundaries
- Detailed width measurement requests
- Unit label visibility verification
- Form spacing and proportion assessment

This enhanced approach ensures GPT can effectively identify and report width-related layout issues that impact user experience.


## Specification-Based Testing Prompt

When Claude Code needs to create comprehensive tests from a specification, use this prompt:

**"Analyze this specification and create tests focusing on the 3 most critical aspects:**

**SPECIFICATION:** [paste specification]

**Requirements:**
1. **Identify the 3 most critical requirements** from the spec and explain why
2. **Create Puppeteer test file** (`testing/[feature-name]-visual-test.js`) that:
   - Screenshots desktop (1920x1080) and mobile (375x667) 
   - Tests all 3 critical requirements with specific validation
   - Checks console errors, 404s, form element height consistency
   - Includes overlap detection for layout issues
3. **OpenAI Vision Analysis** using critical visual inspection prompt focused on the 3 most important visual aspects
4. **Accuracy Testing** (if calculator): Test against original if URL provided, Â±10% tolerance
5. **Generate test report** with pass/fail status and actionable recommendations

Output: Complete test file, identified critical areas, and enhanced vision prompts."**

This prompt ensures comprehensive testing focused on what matters most from the specification.

## Mobile Layout Centering Standards

### Mobile-First Design Testing Requirements

When testing any web application interface, mobile centering should be validated as a standard practice:

â **Mobile Layout Testing (â¤480px screens)**
- Home page content is centered on narrow screens
- Card-based layouts (content grids, feature cards, product cards, dashboard widgets) are properly centered
- Form inputs and buttons are centered and accessible
- CTAs and important headings are centered
- Logo and branding elements are centered
- Navigation is optimized for touch (drawer/hamburger style)
- All interactive elements are thumb-friendly sized (min 44px)

â **Content Alignment Standards**
- **Should be centered:** Home page content, card layouts, form inputs, CTAs, headings, logos, navigation, dashboard widgets, product grids
- **Should stay left-aligned:** Long paragraph text, lists, detailed content, navigation links in drawers, article content, documentation
