# Templates

**Purpose**: Reusable templates and patterns that can be applied to new projects or tasks.

Templates are **things to reuse** - standardized structures, formats, and content that provide consistency across projects.

## Current Templates
- `create-new-project.md` - Template for creating new TrainerDay projects

## When to Add Templates
- Repeated patterns emerge across multiple projects
- Standardized formats prove useful
- Common project structures are identified
- Reusable content saves time and ensures consistency
