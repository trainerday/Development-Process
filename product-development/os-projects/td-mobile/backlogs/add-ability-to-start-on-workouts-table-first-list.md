# Add Ability to Start on Workouts Table First List

## Overview
Add 3 startup options for the app:
1. Start on Today Tab
2. Start on Workouts Tab  
3. Start with Quick Start

Default should be to start on Today tab. When starting on workouts tab, default to the first list (after plan). Alex will be changing the order of these lists.

## Priority
Medium

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add setting for startup tab preference
- [ ] Implement Today Tab as default startup
- [ ] Implement Workouts Tab startup option
- [ ] Implement Quick Start startup option
- [ ] When starting on Workouts Tab, default to first list after plan
- [ ] Settings should persist between app launches

## Technical Notes
- Need to coordinate with Alex on the order of workout lists
- Should integrate with existing settings system
