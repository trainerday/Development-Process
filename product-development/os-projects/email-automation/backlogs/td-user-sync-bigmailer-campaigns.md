# TD User Sync & BigMailer Campaigns

## Business Purpose
Enable TrainerDay to maintain regular communication with our user base through professional email campaigns that showcase our continuous product improvements and maintain user engagement.

## Main Sentiment
After 285 days without a major update email, we need a streamlined process to:
- Keep users informed about the 300+ improvements we've made
- Showcase our dedicated development team's achievements
- Maintain a personal connection from founder Alex V
- Remind users of our commitment to accessible pricing ($3.99/month)

## Key Objectives
1. **User Engagement**: Re-engage users who may have forgotten about TrainerDay's continuous improvements
2. **Feature Awareness**: Highlight major enhancements across mobile, web, billing, and integrations
3. **Team Recognition**: Give credit to our dev team with personalized, fun titles
4. **Personal Touch**: Maintain Alex V's personal voice and connection with users
5. **Growth**: Drive users back to the platform and potentially convert free users

## Success Criteria
- Ability to send quarterly update emails efficiently
- Maintain BigMailer contact list synchronized with MongoDB users
- Create professional emails that work across all email clients
- Preserve the personal, founder-led communication style
- Streamline from hours of manual work to a 30-minute process

## Implementation Approach
Create a three-step workflow:
1. Sync new users from MongoDB to BigMailer
2. Generate development summary content
3. Create and send email campaign

The solution should be code-based initially, with potential for a web interface in the future.
