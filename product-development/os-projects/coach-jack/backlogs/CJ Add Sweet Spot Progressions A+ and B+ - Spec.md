# CJ Add Sweet Spot Progressions A+ and B+ - Requirements

## Current State

Coach Jack currently has limited sweet spot progression options. Users need additional advanced sweet spot workouts that provide variety and progressive overload for intermediate to advanced cyclists.

## Desired Outcome  

**Primary Goals:**
1. Create two new sweet spot progressions: A+ and B+ variants
2. Provide more challenging sweet spot options for experienced riders
3. Maintain progressive structure while increasing difficulty

**User Experience:** Advanced users have access to more challenging sweet spot sessions that continue to drive adaptation after mastering basic sweet spot progressions.

## Interaction Mechanism

**Progression Structure:**
- A+ variant: Higher intensity sweet spot (92-96% FTP)
- B+ variant: Longer duration sweet spot intervals
- Both maintain sweet spot training zone benefits

**Workout Variations:**
- Extended interval durations
- Reduced recovery between intervals  
- Higher target power ranges
- Combined with other training elements

**Selection Logic:**
- Available to users who have completed basic sweet spot progressions
- Integrated into periodization as advanced base/build options
- Progressive difficulty within each A+ and B+ series

## Special Requirements

**Intensity Guidelines:**
- A+ progression: 92-96% FTP (upper sweet spot)
- B+ progression: Extended durations at 88-92% FTP
- Maintain aerobic benefits while increasing challenge

**Progression Principles:**
- Start conservatively and build difficulty
- Include adequate recovery between sessions
- Scale with user's demonstrated capabilities

**Integration:**
- Fit within existing Coach Jack periodization
- Available as alternatives to standard sweet spot
- Consider user preference for intensity vs. duration

## Additional Context

**Reference:** Trello card MhM6MwkI "CJ - add 2 sweet spot progressions A+ B+"

**Training Benefits:**
- Sweet spot training improves FTP and aerobic capacity
- A+ variant targets VO2max boundary
- B+ variant builds muscular endurance

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Need workout library expansion
- Integration with difficulty progression algorithms
- User feedback and adaptation tracking
