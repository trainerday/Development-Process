# CJ AI Summary with User Tags from LLM - Requirements

## Current State

After users answer questions in the Coach Jack interface, there's no system to convert their responses into standardized user tags that can be used for plan matching and personalization.

## Desired Outcome  

**Primary Goals:**
1. Use LLM to convert user question responses into standardized user tags
2. Display generated tags for user verification and confidence building
3. Create both custom user-specific tags and generic standardized tags
4. Maintain tag history and evolution over time

**User Experience:** Users see that the system understands them through clearly displayed, accurate tags that they can review and confirm before plan generation.

## Interaction Mechanism

**Tag Generation:**
- LLM processes all user responses and generates relevant tags
- Mix of custom tags specific to the user and generic system tags
- Tags grouped by categories (Goals, Experience, Constraints, Preferences, etc.)

**User Review Interface:**
- Clear display of generated tags with explanations
- Ability to modify, add, or remove tags
- Confidence indicators showing how tags relate to user responses
- Visual organization by tag category

**Tag Categories:**
- Goals (event-specific, health, performance)
- Training Experience and History
- Schedule Constraints and Availability
- Motivation Style and Preferences
- Physical Characteristics and Limitations

## Special Requirements

**LLM Integration:**
- Claude AI artifact for tag display interface
- Structured prompt engineering for consistent tag generation
- Fallback logic for incomplete or unclear responses

**Tag Standardization:**
- Generic tags like "[Phase: Build]" for system compatibility
- Custom tags that capture unique user characteristics
- Version control for tag definitions and meanings

**Data Management:**
- Tag history preservation alongside question history
- Tag evolution tracking over time
- Integration with plan matching algorithms

## Additional Context

**Reference:** Trello card smXEetx6 "CJ - AI Summary (User Tags generated from LLM)"

**Tag Examples:**
- Generic: [Phase: Build], [Intensity: Moderate], [Equipment: Smart Trainer]
- Custom: [Goal: Sub-3hr Century], [Constraint: Early Morning Only], [Preference: Outdoor Focus]

**Integration with Andrey's Work:**
- Andrey will use these tags to create optimal plan matching
- Tags serve as input to plan recommendation algorithms
- Quality of tags directly impacts plan personalization effectiveness



**Implementation Notes:**
- Start with core tag categories and expand based on usage
- A/B testing for tag display and review interfaces
- User feedback collection on tag accuracy and usefulness
