# System State Hierarchy

## Overview
This document outlines the hierarchical state management for the td-ai-testing project.

## State Levels
- **Application Level**: Global application state
- **Feature Level**: Feature-specific state management
- **Component Level**: Local component state

## State Flow
Data flows from higher-level states down to component-level states, with actions flowing upward to modify higher-level states.

## Implementation Notes
- State management approach to be defined based on tech stack selection
- Consider scalability and maintainability requirements
