# Backlogs

This folder contains specification documents for planned features and tasks.

## Structure
- Each task should have a corresponding `[Task Name] - Spec.md` file
- Specs should include requirements, technical details, and acceptance criteria
- Once completed, specs are moved to `../backlogs-completed/backlog-specs/`
