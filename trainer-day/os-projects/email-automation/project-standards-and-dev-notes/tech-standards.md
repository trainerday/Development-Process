# Email Automation - Technical Standards

## Code Standards

### JavaScript/Node.js
- Use ES6+ features
- Async/await for asynchronous operations
- Proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions)

### Express.js Conventions
- Modular route structure
- Middleware for common functionality
- Proper HTTP status codes
- RESTful API design principles

### File Structure
```
email-automation/
├── bin/              # Server startup scripts
├── routes/           # Express routes
├── views/            # EJS templates
├── public/           # Static assets
├── models/           # Data models (when needed)
├── services/         # Business logic
├── middleware/       # Custom middleware
└── config/           # Configuration files
```

## Development Practices

### Version Control
- Meaningful commit messages
- Feature branches for new development
- Pull requests for code review

### Testing
- Unit tests for services
- Integration tests for routes
- Test coverage targets

### Security
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Input validation and sanitization
- HTTPS in production
- Rate limiting for APIs

## Deployment Standards

### Staging (UAT)
- Deploy to uat.trainerday.com
- Full testing before production
- Performance monitoring

### Production
- Deploy to prod.trainerday.com
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Monitoring and alerting
- Regular backups

## Email-Specific Standards

### Email Templates
- Responsive design
- Plain text fallbacks
- Proper unsubscribe mechanisms
- CAN-SPAM compliance

### Email Sending
- Queue system for bulk sends
- Retry logic for failures
- Rate limiting to avoid spam flags
- Delivery tracking
